# Pony Panic API Client Game Play Automation

As the name suggests, this is a game client implementation for a game called "PonyPanic". The code is designed to interact with a game API, automatically navigate a hero character around the map to collect treasures while avoiding obstacles, and advance to the next level when all treasures are collected.
